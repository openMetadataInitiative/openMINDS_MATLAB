# openMINDS_MATLAB - For Developers

This folder contains developer's tools for checking and testing code as well as 
packaging the toolbox as an mltbx file.

The tools in this folder is inspired by and adapted from the 
[Climate Data Store Toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/mathworks/climatedatastore)
