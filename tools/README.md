# openMINDS_MATLAB - For Developers

This folder contains developer's tools for checking and testing code as well as 
packaging the toolbox as an mltbx file. The tools are integrated with GitHub actions but can also be run locally.

The tools in this folder is inspired by and adapted from the 
[Climate Data Store Toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/mathworks/climatedatastore)

## Build Pipeline

All MATLAB classes representing schema types are automatically generated by the openMINDS pipeline. For more details, explore the code on the [`pipeline`](https://github.com/openMetadataInitiative/openMINDS_MATLAB/tree/pipeline) branch or review the [summary](https://github.com/openMetadataInitiative/openMINDS_documentation/blob/iss25-doc-pipeline/docs/shared/contribution_guidelines/build_pipelines.rst) (Note: draft version) on the main openMINDS documentation pages
